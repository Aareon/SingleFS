# SingleFS
A self-hostable file-server written by ChatGPT.

## Is this really written by ChatGPT?
In part, ChatGPT was used to create the frontend for SingleFS. There is a caveat, in that ChatGPT does not remember context and has limits as to how much code it can write in one shot. ChatGPT was leveraged in a way that it wrote each individual website component, and was plugged together and modified by a human to be functional and cohesive.

## Why does SingleFS exist?
A few reasons; one being to test the limitations and functionality of ChatGPT, another being as a simple project to waste time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Flask

Made with ❤️ using Python.
